By the use of hashing algoritm, organisation could issue any digital content on the platform without the need of exposing the whole file itself to the public through the nature of one way function of hashing algorithm. Issuer is then required to publish the fixed length of hash result (32 bytes) through the portal which then store on CamDL blockchain network. Only those who got hold the original digital content of the file could perform hashing and obtain the result published on the ledger which could guarantee the immutability and originality of the digital content from the issuance organisation.

Digital signature platform uses SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2 - 256 bits). SHA-2 was first published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. federal standard. [More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
